            <p>Diwali is my favorite festival. On this day Lord Ram returned to Ayodhya after killing Ravana. It is a festival of
            light. People decorate their houses. Shopkeepers start new ledger from this day. Goddess Lakshmi is worshippedin the
            evening. People distribute sweets and gifts among friends and relatives. There is a practice f exploding crackers at
            night which is not good for health and environment. We must avoid crackers. I enjoy Diwali very much.</p>
            <pre>The sands of time have rendered fear
            Blue skies on high no longer clear
            Stars were bright whence they came
            Now dimmed, obscured, pollution's haze
            
            Crystal clear our waters gleamed
            Fish abundant, rivers streamed
            Ocean floors sandy white
            Now littered, brown, pollution's plight
            
            Trees towered high above
            Trunks baring professed love
            Birds chirping from sites unseen
            Gone, paper joined pollution's team
            
            One can't blame pollution alone
            As they say, you reap what you've sown
            So let us plant a better seed
            Tear out old roots, cultivate, weed
            
            Protect what has been given for free
            Our waters, skies, wildlife and trees
            For once they're gone, don't you say
            Consider yourself warned of that fatal day
